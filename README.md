# Video-Chat-Applicaton
This is a clone of microsoft teams made as a part of the microsoft engae mentorship program

It uses HTML, CSS AND JavaScript for the client side and NodeJS and ExpressJS for the server side.
I have used mongoDB and mongoose for database.
Socket.io for communication between server and client side and PeerJS library to establish peer to peer connections

It has the following features:
1. Group video calling
2. before, in and after meeting perssitent chat
3. "hand raise" and "be right back gesture" that can be used through both UI and voice commands
